## person 1
Name: *KIMI 李子禾*  
Today's work:
- finish the opencv program(camera control)
Tommorrow's plan:  
- optimize the program of the user interface

### The problem met today: 
Problem1:  
- The camera is very hard to control and requires large amount of mathematical thinking. So I came to deepseek for help.  
- Due to the lack of knowledge, the program is mostly generated by AI. Further code breakdown will be done after the program is finished.
Solution:  
Deepseek gives detailed code according to my questions.
```Python
import cv2

# Open the default camera (index 0)
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(1)

# Set the frame rate
fps = 15
cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS, fps)
# Set the resolution, e.g., to 640x480
width = 1920
height = 1080
cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, width)
cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT, height)

print("open")
# Check if the camera was successfully opened
if not cap.isOpened():
    print("Unable to open camera")
    exit()
print("now try read")
while True:
    # Read a frame from the camera
    ret, frame = cap.read()

    # Check if the frame was successfully read
    if not ret:
        print("Unable to capture image frame")
        break

    # Display the image frame
    cv2.imshow('Camera Feed', frame)

    # Press 'q' to exit the loop
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# Release the camera resources
cap.release()
# Close all OpenCV windows
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```
