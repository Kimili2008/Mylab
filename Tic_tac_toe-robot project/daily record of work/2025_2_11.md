Today's work:
- finish the total opencv program

Tommorrow's plan:  
- optimize the opencv program

### The problem met today: 
Problem1:  
The opencv module in python makes pieces recognization very easy because all mathematical process is ignored.  
But this brings some problems - I don't know the technical details of it.  
Both the code from other's github or AI are all susceptive to small changes in light source, especially for objects with a high reflectivity.  
  
Solution:  
After changing the theshold parimeters for many times, it gets better.  
Also, I cover the pieces with papers, which have lower reflectivity.  

Code:
```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Open the camera
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while True:
    # Read a frame from the camera
    ret, frame = cap.read()

    if not ret:
        print("Error reading frame from camera.")
        break

    # Convert the frame to grayscale
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    # Apply Gaussian blur to reduce noise
    gray = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray, (9, 9), 2, 2)

    # Use the HoughCircles function to detect circles
    # the function is to detect circle, the arguments should be fine tuned !!!
    circles = cv2.HoughCircles(gray, cv2.HOUGH_GRADIENT, 1,
                               minDist=20,
                               param1=30, #
                               param2=40, #
                               minRadius=15,
                               maxRadius=60)

    # Check if circles were found
    if circles is not None:
        # Convert the (x, y) coordinates and radius of the circles to integers
        circles = np.round(circles[0, :]).astype("int")

        # Loop over the circles
        for (x, y, r) in circles:
            # xinghua added 250211 
            # calculate the center region's average brightness to tell black/white chess
            # black/white threshold should be changed accorodingly
            roi = gray[y-5:y+5, x-5:x+5]
            average_brightness = np.mean(roi)
            if(average_brightness < 100): #back
                render_color = (0, 0, 255)
            elif (average_brightness > 180):#white
                render_color = (0, 255, 0)
            else: 
                render_color = (255, 0, 0)
            # Draw the circle in the output frame
            cv2.circle(frame, (x, y), r, render_color, 2)
            # Draw a rectangle corresponding to the center of the circle
            cv2.rectangle(frame, (x - 3, y - 3), (x + 3, y + 3), render_color, -1)

    # Display the frame with detected circles
    cv2.imshow("Detected Circles", frame)
    cv2.imshow("gray", gray)

    # Break the loop if 'q' is pressed
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# Release the camera and close all OpenCV windows
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```
