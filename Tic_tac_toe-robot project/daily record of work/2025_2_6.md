Name: *KIMI 李子禾*  
Today's work:
- be able to control the speed of the robotic arm
- programme the user interface(AI part) of the Tic_tac_toe.

Tommorrow's plan:  
- optimize the program of the user interface
- wait for new components to be delivered
- design the game board(The board has to be decent in shape, easy to make and have space for the robotic arm to move.)  

### The problem met today: 
Problem1:  
The Robotic arm is too short to operate the stones in stationary positions.  
Solution to the problem:     
I bought a stepper-controlled 175mm linear slide with a stepper operation module. Hence the robotic arm can cover enough area with one more degree of freedom.  
Problem2:  
When many stones exist on the board together at the same time. The claw might accidently touch other stones.   
Solution to the problem:  
With respect to movement convenience, an electromagnet is introduced and with the controlling module, it can pick up stones easily.  

The tic-tac-toe Program,in which the user inputs the board, and the program gives the AI best move.  
```python
def check_winner(board, player):
            #rows,columns and diagonals
            for row in board:

                    return player
            for col in range(3):
                if all(board[row][col] == player for row in range(3)):
