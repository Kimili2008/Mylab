## person 1
Name: *KIMI 李子禾*  
Today's work:
- finish the arudino-python communication program
  
Tommorrow's plan:
- test the angles of servos and pos of stepper in terms of different positions.
- make the workflow of the total program
- change the appearance of the whole board

Problem1:  
When trying to communicate between arduino and python, I found that the serial is baffingly refuse to connect with thw computer.  
  
Solution:  
The arduino IDE has an embedded function called the serial monitor, but it can actually jam the serial so other devices can't connect.  
After turning off this function, it's fine.  
code:
```python
# UI activate.
# Create the serial connection. Connect with the board.
# Wait for the player to choose sides.
# The player inputs a position // place the stone.
# The robot arm places the piece.

import serial

# Create a serial object, specifying the port and baud rate
ser = serial.Serial('COM7', 9600)  # Replace with your port number


def send_to_arduino(data):
    """Send a readable stream of bytes to Arduino."""
    ser.write(data.encode())

# Send the initial mode to Arduino
send_to_arduino("Whitemode")

while True:
    # Check if there is data waiting to be read from Arduino
    if ser.in_waiting > 0:
        data = ser.readline().decode()  # Read a line of data
        print("Received from Arduino: ", data)  # Print the received data

    # Get input message from the user
    data1 = input("Message? ")
    if data1 == "end":  # Exit the loop if the user types "end"
        break
    else:
        send_to_arduino(data1)  # Otherwise, send the message to Arduino
```
