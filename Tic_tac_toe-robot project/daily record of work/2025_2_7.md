Name: *KIMI 李子禾*  
Today's work:
- design the game board(The board has to be decent in shape, easy to make and have space for the robotic arm to move.)  
Tommorrow's plan:  
- optimize the program of the user interface
- wait for new components to be delivered

### The problem met today: 
Problem1:  
When designing the board, the 3d-printed board was used at first, but it was replaced quickly because it doesn't have a robust structure.  
Solution:  
We decide to use the opencv so that hall-sensors are not used in the project, and the board can be hand-made.
